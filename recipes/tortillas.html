    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade tortillas are one of those things that you don't really "get" until you've tried them. Why go through all of this trouble when you can just buy a 10 pack at the store for a few dollar? Oh, my friend, one bite and you'll understand why.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup extra virgin olive</li>
        <li>1 Cup warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, salt and baking powder in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook, mix dry ingredients until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add oil and water with mixer running at a medium speed. After about 1 minute, or when mixture comes together and begins to form a ball, decrease mixing speed to low. Continue to mix for 1 minute or until dough is smooth.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 16 equal portions. Turn each piece to coat with flour. Form each piece into a ball and flatten with the palm of your hand. Cover flattened balls of dough with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for at least 15 minutes (or as much as 2 hours) before proceeding.</li>
        <li>After the rest period, heat a large pan over medium heat. Roll each dough piece into a rough circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter, keep work surface and rolling pin lightly floured. Don’t stack uncooked tortillas on top of each other or they will stick together. (I like to separate my tortillas with parchement paper.)</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, place one dough circle into the pan and allow to cook 45 seconds to 1 minute or until the bottom surface has a few pale brown spots and the uncooked surface is bubbly. If browning too fast, reduce the heat a bit. If it’s taking longer than a minute to see a few pale golden brown spots on the underside of tortillas, increase the heat a bit. Flip to other side and cook for 15-20 seconds. The tortillas should be nice and soft but have a few small brown spots on the surface. </li>
        <li>Remove from pan with tongs and stack in a covered container or zippered bag to keep the tortillas soft. </li>
        <li>Serve warm or allow to cool for later use. When ready to use, place a slightly damp paper towel in the bottom of a microwave-safe container (with a cover) that will hold the stacked tortillas. Microwave uncovered for 15-30 seconds (start with 15) or until warm, then keep covered to hold heat while serving.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container or zippered bag at room temperature for 24 hours or refrigerate for up to 1 week. To freeze, separate tortillas with parchment paper or waxed paper and place in a zippered bag before placing in the freezer.</li>
