    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the best homemade pizza recipe that I have found after a lifetime of making a <em>whole lot</em> of homemade pizza. The crust is crispy and delicious, the sauce is flavorful, and the cheese gets perfectly browned without burning. I might go make it now!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>Dough</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2.25 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>5 cups bread flour (plus ~1 cup extra, will vary by preferred texture)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2-4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Cheese</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb low moisture, whole milk mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 ¼ cups warm water, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon active dry yeast in a large mixing bowl. Give it a lil stir and then let it sit for a few minutes until it starts to get foamy.</li>
        <li>Once you find yourself comfortably in foam city, add some 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Add the 5 cups of bread flour. Begin to knead the dough, folding it over itself and pushing it away from you, repeat. </li>
        <li>Add more flour as needed. I personally like the results from a wetter dough but that makes it harder to work with later on. Add flour, knead, flour, knead, until the desired “tackiness” of the dough ball is reached. You should be able to stretch the dough out very thin without it ripping by the time it is ready.</li>
        <li>Form a large dough ball. Now, divide it in half. Then divide the halves into halves. Take 4 containers and oil the insides with olive oil. Rest a dough ball in each one and cover with plastic wrap or a towel. </li>
        <li>For the sauce, just mix all of the listed ingredients in a bowl in any order, and give it a stir.</li>
        <li>With your oven preheated to its highest temperature (preferably for an hour beforehand and with a pizza stone or steel on the uppermost rack), cook the pizza for 7-10 minutes until the cheese is caramelized in spots, but before it burns.</li>
        <li>Cool on a cooling rack, and then, enjoy!</li>
